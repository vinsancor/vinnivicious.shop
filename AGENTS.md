## Architecture
- Keep the bar experience as a client-only home route with separate scene, gallery, and menu modules; WebGL must not run during SSR.
- Store the proposed menu in a browser-safe data module, with category-count tests; presentation and menu content can change independently.
- Use React Three Fiber for full-bleed procedural orbit lines and GSAP ScrollTrigger for scroll choreography; no external runtime 3D assets are needed.
- Keep all visual styling and scene palette roles in the global design system; scene colors are read from CSS tokens after mounting.
- Treat the menu and generated photography as editorial proposals, not verified venue facts; do not invent prices, contact details, opening times, or live booking behavior.
